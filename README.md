# 📘 Machine Learning Journey

**Machine Learning Journey** is a **structured learning framework** for anyone who wants to finally start Machine Learning without confusion.  
It combines **theory + practice** in one place, so you don’t need scattered notes or separate projects.  

With a clear roadmap, 2h/day routine, and organized repo structure, you can:  
- Learn ML concepts step by step  
- Practice directly in Jupyter notebooks  
- Keep everything tracked and easy to review later  
- Gradually build your own personal ML playbook

## ✨ Features

- **Structured learning path** → follow a week-by-week roadmap (2h/day)  
- **Theory + Practice together** → no need for separate notes; notebooks & reports are connected  
- **Forkable & Reusable** → anyone can fork and start learning with the same structure  
- **LaTeX reports (optional)** → generate clean summaries if you want academic-style notes  
- **Automatic builds** → GitHub Actions builds PDFs for you  
- **Future-ready** → extend to bilingual docs or website if needed
